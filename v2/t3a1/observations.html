<!-- Full tree -->

    <div class="in2 box w7 float">

    <h2><a name="s2">The full tree</a></h2>

    <p>
        Although we stated at the start of the site we would be concentrating on the
        odd numbers, let us first look at the whole tree. This can be constructed by combining all the
        individual sequences, like the one based on 29 we saw on the home page, into a
        single tree. This illustration shows a few nodes near the root.

        <div align="center">
            <img src="images/tree.gif" width="486" height="456"></p>
        </div>

    <p>

    I've coloured the nodes to highlight some aspects of the structure.

    <p>
        <table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
          <tr>
            <td>Yellow</td>
            <td>Multiples of 2</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Red</td>
            <td>Multiples of 3</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Green</td>
            <td>Numbers of the form 6n+1</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Blue</td>
            <td>Numbers of the form 6n+5</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

    <p>

        The tree consists of a collection of infinitely long strings of even numbers [...,
        16n, 8n, 4n, 2n], each one rooted on an odd number, 'n'. The illustration shows the
        strings based on 1, 3, 5 and 21.

    </p><p>

        Some of these strings spawn sub-strings (for instance, 16 in the string based on 1 spawns a new
        string based on 5). Strings based on multiples of 3 never spawn
        sub-strings, other odd numbers spawn a new string every second node (1st,
        3rd, 5th, ... for blue nodes and 2nd, 4th, 6th, ... for green ones).

    </p><p>
        The root of the tree is the loop [4,2,1]. This is probably the only loop. If
        there are any other loops they will anchor independent trees that have no
        connections to this one.

    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="in2 box w7 float">

    <h2>The <a name="s3">odd tree</a></h2>

    <p>
        As we have noted earlier, all even numbers are the product of an odd number
        and a power of 2. Once the sequence encounters an even number we are destined to
        reach the root odd number. We can simplify the above tree by collapsing the
        infinite set [n, 2n, 4n, 8n, ...] into the single node 'n'. When we do this to
        the previous tree we get this simpler representation

        <div align="center">
            <img src="images/oddtree.gif" width="283" height="223">
        </div>

    </p><p>

        The [4,2,1] loop reduces to just '1'. The numbers on the lines represent the number of iterations to get from one
        number to the next, one more than the number of even numbers encountered along
        the way and hence one more than the 'a' values mentioned on the <a href="index.html">introductory page</a>
        and discussed in more detail on the <a href="a_lists.html">a-lists page</a>. To calculate how far numbers are from the root we have
        add together the lengths of these vectors. For example, to get from 213 to 1 will take
        8&nbsp;+&nbsp;5&nbsp;=&nbsp;13 steps.

    </p><p>

        The set of odd numbers that precedes a value displays the colour sequence green, blue, red, though
        they don't always start on the same colour. This is because these numbers follow the sequence
        n&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;4n&nbsp;+&nbsp;1. For instance the
        predecessors of 5 follow the sequence 3, 13, 53, 213, ...

    </p><p>

        Drawing these trees by hand (as in the above example) is a bit tedious so
        most similar images on this site are generated using
        a combination of Python
        and <a href="http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/">GraphViz</a>. A Python
        script creates the GraphViz 'dot' files and GraphViz converts these to illustrations. Click <a href="upto201.html">here</a>
        to see the tree containing all the odd numbers up to 201.

        <a href="sizerecords.html">Size Records</a>: Every sequence will have a
        largest member. As we explore the sequences generated from ever increasing seed values we will
        continuously encounter larger largest values. This page enumerates a few of
        these record holders.

    </p><p>

        Length Records: Each sequence will have a length. As we increase the seed
        value we will encounter longer sequences. Each time we encounter a sequence that
        is longer than all the previous ones this will be a length record. <i>To be
        continued.</i>

<!-- Glide Tree -->

    <div class="in2 box w7 float">

    <h2>The <a name="s4"> glide tree</a></h2>

    <p>
        Glides are sequences that end when a number smaller than the seed is
        encountered. The sequence we met earlier based on 29

    <p class="code">

        [29, 88, 44, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]

    <p>

        includes the glide

    <p class="code">

        [29, 88, 44, 22]

    <p>

        as 22 is the first number smaller than 29 encountered. I prefer to work with
        odd glides, and ignore the even numbers. The glide of 29 then becomes

    <p class="code">

        [29, 11].

    <p>

        Construct a glide sequence: <input type="text" id="number1" size="12">
                                    <button onclick="DrawGlideSequence();"> Show </button>
        <p>

        <div class="code in2 w6">
            <p class="code" id="result1"> &nbsp; <p>
        </div><p>

    </p><p>

        The odd glide maps one odd number to second (smaller) one, so it will eventually arrive at 1 (or get caught in a loop).
        This gives us another way of
        constructing a tree of odd numbers, the &quot;glide tree&quot;. This
        illustration shows the glide tree for odd numbers up to 39. Note that '1' is
        drawn differently, to identify that there isn't a glide. In 3x+1 this is the only
        known number that doesn't have a glide, but in other systems like 3x+5 there can
        be many (see &quot;Glide Structure&quot;, below).

        <div align="center">
            <img src="images/struct1_39.png">
        </div>
    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="glide_structure.html">Glide Structure</a>:  If you start with a value and
        iterate until you reach a smaller value you have a &quot;glide&quot;.&nbsp;Join
        all these together and you have the glide structure. In 3x+1 the structure
        is a tree. This link shows the 3x+1 tree for a larger range of values and also examines the structure of other systems,
        3x+5, 7, 11 and 13, where there
        are multiple loops. Where the basic tree seems to be tall and narrow, the glide
        trees tend to be short and wide.

    </p><p>

        <a href="oddglides.html">Glide Record Holders</a>: These identify the longest
        glide encountered so far as we increase the seed number. The link actually
        refers to a page showing the first 12 odd glide record holders. These get quite
        long quite quickly, for instance, the 3rd record holder is 27, which has 38
        members.
    </p>

    <div class="in2">
    <p class="code">[27, 41, 31, 47, 71, 107, 161, 121, 91, 137, 103, 155, 233, 175, 263, 395, 593, 445, 167, 251, 377, 283, 425, 319, 479, 719, 1079, 1619, 2429, 911, 1367, 2051, 3077, 577, 433, 325, 61,
    23]</p>
    </div>
    <p><a href="glidechainrecords.html">Glide Chain Records</a>:  If you examine the
    diagram above you can see that '3' is the smallest number only one step away
    from 1. The smallest number two steps away is 7, and for 3 steps it is 9. These,
    being the smallest numbers at successive distances from the root form the glide
    chain record holders. The <a href="glidechainrecords.html">Glide Chain Records</a>  page
    explores these record holders for a larger sequence of seeds.</p>

    <!-- Residues -->

    <div class="in2 box w7 float">

    <h2><a name="s5"> Residues</a></h2>

    <p>
        The &quot;residue&quot; of a sequence is calculated by counting the number of odd and
        even terms in a descent and then calculating 2<span class="superscript">even</span>/(x&nbsp;*&nbsp;3<span class="superscript">odd</span>).
        If we choose x=7, for instance we get the series [7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2,
        1], which has 11 even and 5 odd members (we don't count the '1'),&nbsp; so:

    <p class="code">

        R(7) = 2<span class="superscript">11</span>/ (7&nbsp;*&nbsp;3<span class="superscript">5</span>) = 2048/1701 = 1.2039976...

    <p>

        Eric Roosendaal introduces residues on one of his pages -
        see <a href="http://www.ericr.nl/wondrous/index.html">http://www.ericr.nl/wondrous/index.html</a>
        - where he discusses the non-uniformity of the distribution and postulates that the largest residue is
        R(993):

    <p class="code">

        R(993) = 2<span class="superscript">61</span>/ (993 * 3<span class="superscript">32</span>) = 1.2531421...

    <p>
        This chart shows the residue distribution for all the odd numbers in the range
        3 to 1048575, in bins of 0.001. See the following links for more information.
    <p>
        <img class="noborder" src="images/residue_chart.gif" width="781" height="287">
    <p>
        Residues can be calculated from the a-list generated by the seed (<a href="index.html">see the introductory page</a>).
        Set 'n' to the number of 'a' values and 'm' to their sum.
        The residue is now:
    <p class="code">
        R(seed) = 2<span class="superscript">m</span>/(seed&nbsp;x&nbsp;3<span class="superscript">n</span>)
        &equiv;
        (2/3)<span class="superscript">n</span> x 2<span class="superscript">m-n</span> / seed;
    <p>
        The second version is better for calculating as it is less likely to overflow and
        probably more accurate. Calculate a residue: <input type="text" id="number2" size="12">
                                    <button onclick="ShowResidue();"> Show </button>
